CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcmake_helpers.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "cmake_helpers", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cmake_helpers"
  with any of the following names:

    cmake_helpersConfig.cmake
    cmake_helpers-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cmake_helpers" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "cmake_helpers_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "cmake_helpers" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
